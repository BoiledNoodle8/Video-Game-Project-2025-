# Tank Game

### Mechanics (What players interact with)
The players play as tanks in a maze like arena competing to be the last one alive in multiple rounds! This will be a first to 3 round wins is the victor! The controls will be the typical 8 directions and they will be able to shoot rounds. These bullets bounce off of walls, and you can even be blown up by your own bullets. Power ups can also spawn! These can vary from 
- A shield that blocks one bullet
- Scattershot (think like a shotgun blast)
- Homing Rocket
- A quicker bullet
- Ghost (Can pass through walls for a short bit)

### Dynamics (What changes)
As the score goes up, the winning player gets a crown on their tank. The map will also change per round. I plan on making around 10 or so maps. 

### Aestetics (The look)
A sort of retro 2D look. I dont want to have to think to hard about the look so I can focus on making the game fun.
